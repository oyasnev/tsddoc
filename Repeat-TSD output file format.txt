The tool has to process all repeats in input file and output info about TSD around every repeat.

Output file format should be in CSV with ';' (semicolon) as a delimiter.
The order of the fields should be:

* Sequence name    
    # chrX
* Repeat class/family
    # LINE/L1
* Repeat name
    # L1MB2
* Repeat start position in sequence
    # 74918
* Repeat end position in sequence
    # 74968
* Strand: '+' - forward strand, 'C' - complement strand
    # +
* TSD flag: 1 - repeat has TSD, 0 - no TSD
    # 1
If repeat has TSD then additional fields with TSD info must be specified:

* First aligned TSD
    # TAAAAA_AAAG
* First TSD start position
    # 74906
* Second aligned TSD
    # TAAAAATAAAG
* Second TSD start position
    # 74969
* TSD length (should be the length of aligned TSDs)
    # 11
* Edit distance
    # 1

    
Example:
chrX;LINE/L1;L1MB2;74918;74968;+;1;TAAAAA_AAAG;74906;TAAAAATAAAG;74969;11;1
